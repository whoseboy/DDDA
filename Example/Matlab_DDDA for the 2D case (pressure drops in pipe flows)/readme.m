
% You can use the scripts to perform the data-driven dimensional analysis for 2D
% system "pressure drops in pipe flows". Runing the scripts 0-5, you can
% get the results

%% Note!!

% 1. Three methods for the gradient calculation are utilized, which are, smoothed gradient calculation; 
% liner interpolation + Finite Difference gradient calcualtion; interpolation with ML + fFinite Difference gradient calculation


% 2. Different noise grades are considered;

% 3. Different clustering parameters are applied and discussed.
