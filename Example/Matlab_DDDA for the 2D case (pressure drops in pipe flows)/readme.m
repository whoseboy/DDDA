
% You can use the scripts to perform the data-driven dimensional analysis for 2D
% system "pressure drops in pipe flows". Runing the scripts 0-5, you can
% get the results

%% Note!!

% 1 Three method for the differential calculation is utilized, smooth differential calculation; 
% liner interpolation + formular differential calcualtion; ML + formular differential calculation


% 2 the result is gotten under different noise grades

% 3 the result is gotten under different clustering parameters
